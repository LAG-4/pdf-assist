# Company Policy Chatbot System

A secure, role-based AI chatbot system that allows employees to get instant answers about company policies and rules while maintaining strict document access controls.

## üéØ Project Overview

This system provides a centralized knowledge base for company policies and procedures, powered by AI to deliver accurate, contextual answers to employee questions. HR administrators maintain full control over the document repository, while employees can interact with an intelligent chatbot without direct access to sensitive documents.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Frontend
- **Next.js** application with TypeScript
- **Clerk authentication** for secure user management and role-based access
- **shadcn/ui components** for consistent, modern UI design
- **Responsive design** for desktop and mobile access
- **Real-time chat interface** with typing indicators and message history

### Backend
- **n8n workflow automation** as the primary backend
- **OpenAI Embeddings** for document vectorization and semantic search
- **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** for generating contextual responses
- **Secure file storage** with access control
- **User management** with role-based permissions

### Data Flow
1. HR uploads PDF documents (policies, rules, procedures)
2. Documents are processed and vectorized using OpenAI Embeddings
3. Employee asks questions through the chat interface
4. System performs semantic search across vectorized documents
5. Gemini 2.5 Flash generates contextual answers based on relevant excerpts
6. Employees receive accurate answers without accessing source documents

## üë• User Roles & Permissions

### HR Administrators
- **Full document access**: Upload, view, update, and delete PDF files
- **Knowledge base management**: Add/remove documents from the system
- **User management**: Create and manage employee accounts
- **Analytics dashboard**: View usage metrics and popular queries
- **Document versioning**: Track changes and maintain audit trails

### Employees
- **Chat interface only**: Ask questions through the AI chatbot
- **No document access**: Cannot view, download, or access source PDFs
- **Question history**: View their previous interactions
- **Bookmark responses**: Save helpful answers for quick reference
- **Feedback system**: Rate response quality to improve the system

## üîê Security Features

- **Document isolation**: Employees never have direct access to source documents
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)**: Strict permission enforcement
- **Audit logging**: Track all document access and modifications
- **Secure file storage**: Encrypted document storage with access tokens
- **Session management**: Secure authentication with automatic timeout
